# BoostConvertor

Boost Convertor is an power electronic device that is used to step up an input DC voltage. The given code represetns an algorithm that is used to control the operation of this convertor. The main part of the convertor is an I (for integral) controller that is used to regulate the duty-cycle and by doing that the output voltage is also controlled. The code is written in C language, for the PIC16F1939 microcontroller. If you want to start the code you need to install MPLAB X IDE on your console.
